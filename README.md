# CafeManagement
Project Description:
The Café Management System is a web-based application designed to manage the operations of a café. The application allows administrators to manage the menu, orders, inventory, and customers. It also provides customers with a simple interface to browse the menu, place orders, and track the status of their orders.
Key Features:
	1. Menu Management:
		○ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for menu items.
		○ Categories for different types of items (e.g., Beverages, Desserts, Main Course).
		○ Option to upload images for each menu item.
		○ Price management and availability status for each item.
	2. Order Management:
		○ Customers can place orders from the menu.
		○ Admin can view, update, and manage orders (e.g., mark as prepared, completed, or canceled).
		○ Real-time order tracking for customers.
		○ Order history for customers and admins.
	3. Inventory Management:
		○ Track stock levels for ingredients and products.
		○ Automatic updates to inventory levels based on orders.
		○ Alerts/notifications for low stock levels.
	4. Customer Management:
		○ Registration and login functionality for customers.
		○ Profile management (e.g., view order history, update personal details).
		○ Admin view of all registered customers.
	5. Reporting & Analytics:
		○ Daily/weekly/monthly sales reports.
		○ Inventory usage reports.
		○ Customer insights (e.g., most frequent customers, most popular items).

	• Database:
		○ H2 (for development and testing) or MySQL/PostgreSQL for production.
	• Thymeleaf or React.js/Angular (Optional): For front-end rendering (Thymeleaf for server-side rendering, React.js/Angular for a more modern front-end).
	• Maven/Gradle: For project build and dependency management.
	• JPA/Hibernate: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
	• JUnit/Mockito: For unit testing.
	• Docker (Optional): For containerization.
